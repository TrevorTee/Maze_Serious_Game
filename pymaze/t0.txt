Computers can help humans do many things. As 
a human assistant, the computer needs to make 
a lot of automatic judgments through restrictions. 
For example:

age=12
if age>=18
    print('adlut')

RUN:>>> adlut

The "if" statement uses a predetermined logic to 
allow the computer to judge TURE and FALSE, and 
then execute the subsequent statement based on the 
judgment result.
